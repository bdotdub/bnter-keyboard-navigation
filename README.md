I really enjoy [Bnter](http://bnter.com/).

What can you do this script?

* `j` - Go to next post
* `k` - Go to previous post
* `c` - New convo
* `r` - Comment to a post (on the convo page)
* `v` - View a post
* `/` - Search

INSTALLING
----------

You should have [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) 0.8 or above on
Firefox. You must have this to run this Greasemonkey script.

Or if you use [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), it should work without
any extensions, just follow the next step.

Then go to http://github.com/bdotdub/bnter-keyboard-navigation/raw/master/bnter_keyboard_navigation.user.js
and it should prompt you to install it.

And that's it!
